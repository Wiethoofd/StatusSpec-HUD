Used with [CastingEssentials](https://github.com/PazerOP/CastingEssentials/releases) to display information about equipped mediguns in the  Team Fortress 2 HUD.

Place the plugin contents of `addons` in the _tf\addons_ folder or in the extracted folder in _custom_.

The contents of your folders should look similar to the following:
```
tf/
└── custom/
    └── TF2-MedigunInfo
        ├── cfg/
        ├── materials/vgui/replay/thumbnails/
        └── resource/ui/
```
